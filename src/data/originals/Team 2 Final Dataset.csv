Sales Manager,A specific product hasn't sold well and you have a lot of inventory left over. What strategies do you implement to sell it and earn a profit?,"First, I would look at the placement of the product, move it closer to the front of the store and redesign the display to attract interest from customers.

Sales Manager,Can you describe a time when you had to respond to a problem at work?,"When I’m faced with a challenge at work, I try to rely on data and logic when I’m coming up with my response. As an example, in my last role we saw a sudden decline in our social media engagement. I was tasked with assessing our strategy and identifying where we needed to shift. I analyzed recent performance for our own pages and how our competitors were performing. By researching platform best practices and applying them in a way that was still consistent with our brand, we were able to turn performance around and end the quarter with strong engagement numbers. We learned a lot from that exercise and it confirmed for leadership that more regular analysis of our social media strategy was needed to keep performance strong on those channels.",Behavioral,Good
Sales Manager,Can you describe a time when you led by example?,"I think that oftentimes, the best opportunities to lead by example are all in your attitude. A big pet peeve of mine is actually when people have a bad attitude about work—not that it’s not okay to be frustrated or even to complain sometimes, but I always try to focus on being productive with those feelings.

I immediately conducted a thorough analysis of campaign metrics, audience feedback, and compared it to our initial projections. Identifying that the messaging didn't resonate well with the audience, I organized focus groups and surveys to gather direct feedback.

To use the platform to its fullest capacity, a customer or business had to sign up for a monthly subscription.

Sales Manager,Describe a time you got angry at work.,"I don't typically experience anger at work, but there have been times when I've felt disappointed and frustrated, which I think is normal. For instance, I felt really let down by one of my coworker's lack of communication last December. The holidays are always a really high demand time for everybody, and especially for those of us who work in sales. Unfortunately, my coworker decided at the last minute that she was going to take the two weeks leading up to Christmas off from work. This would've been fine if I knew ahead of time, but she didn't notify me until the day prior, so I couldn't come up with a plan. Overall, her absence made a stressful period even more so for me. I tried my best to meet expectations while she was out, and after the holidays, I spoke with her and directly asked her to make sure she communicates more effectively about her time off so we can avoid similar situations in the future. Thankfully, she was very apologetic and now considers how her absences impact our collective workflow.",Behavioral,Good
Marketing Manager,Describe a time you got angry at work.,"I try not to allow myself to get angry at work. Instead, I focus on communicating effectively with other parties and generating solutions that allow me to overcome obstacles successfully. For instance, I recently worked on a research project with a large scope alongside five other contributors. This project necessitated a high level of collaboration and cooperation between me and my teammates. Unfortunately, one of the other contributors seemed to struggle with working as a part of a team and regularly communicated using hostile language. Her resistance to our work started to impact the progress we made toward the project's goals. I decided to invite her to have coffee with me privately and discuss ways to optimize our joint approach. She admitted to me that she prefers to work independently, so I proposed that we break our project into smaller parts so she could make individual contributions instead of shared ones. After having this conversation, our relationship improved significantly, and we've become regular collaborators over the last year.",Behavioral,Good
Marketing Manager,Describe how do you handle conflict with coworkers.,"At my previous company, I started working as a content writer just a few weeks after a different content writer, and we quickly became friends. We had similar roles and responsibilities within the company, and we appeared to have similar trajectories with the company. However, I earned a promotion to become a lead writer, causing them to be upset and treat me differently. I asked them to meet with me one on one to discuss my promotion. They said they felt frustrated because they started before me and assumed they would be next to move into a lead writing position. I asked if they wanted my advice about how to earn the promotion in the future, and I shared some tips after they agreed. They thanked me for my feedback and used my feedback to improve their performance, and I recommended them to our manager for a promotion as soon as possible.",Behavioral,Good
Marketing Manager,Describe how do you handle conflict with coworkers.,"We had a new client working with our agency, and my manager asked both me and my coworker to prepare pitches for how to approach their marketing campaign with us. We pitched very different concepts, and the client liked certain aspects of both of our campaigns and asked us to work together. My coworker and I felt frustrated with each other because both believed our strategy was the better option to pursue. However, I suggested we work backward through our projects together. We explained our initial ideas to each other, what research we performed and how we chose tactics for the campaign. This helped us find commonalities between our pitches and how to incorporate them to complement one another. As a result, we delivered a campaign that the client loved so much that they set up an auto-renewal contract with us for several more years.",Behavioral,Good
Sales Manager,Describe how do you handle conflict with coworkers.,"In my most recent position as a client support specialist, my coworker and I were responsible for contacting all of our clients to request updated website login information from them to ensure we had accurate information on record. However, we miscommunicated about how to divide up the client list. I thought I would contact clients with names A through M and she would contact clients with names N through Z, and she thought the opposite. As a result, we contacted the same clients, which caused some confusion and clients for our clients. My coworker and I expressed our frustrations with each other, and we both acknowledged that we misheard each other. I suggested implementing a color-coding system to use on a shared spreadsheet for future projects like this one. This new system works well for us, and we haven't had any similar issues since this incident.",Behavioral,Good

When it’s time to brainstorm or strategize, I prefer working in a group, but feel that independent work suits me better when it comes to deep work.

Working there taught me how to be able to pivot between independent and collaborative work on a dime.",Introductory,Good
Sales Manager,Do you work well with others?,"In my previous job as a shift manager, I was the leader for a night shift at a 24-hour retail store. I had a small team and we all knew each other very well and I focused heavily on communication, honesty and team support.

Sales Manager,Has a manager ever given you too much work? What did you do?,"Everyone will have moments in their career where their workload is heavier than normal. I’ve found that this can happen for a lot of reasons and being adaptable can go a long way. A few years ago, one of my colleagues ended up leaving our company for a different opportunity. Naturally, we all had to step up to take on some extra work while waiting on her backfill. I ended up being asked to take on a lot of her administrative work. There were a lot of small things that, especially when added to my existing workload, became too much for me to handle. After giving it my all for a few weeks, I ended up scheduling time with my manager to discuss my bandwidth. We worked together to prioritize my tasks based on our team’s goals and he helped me delegate.",Behavioral,Good
Sales Manager,Have you ever been on a team where someone was not pulling their own weight? How did you handle it?,I think anyone who has ever worked on a team has worked with an underperforming coworker—that’s just par for the course. What I’ve learned is that empathy will take you a long way. I had a coworker in my last role who routinely missed deadlines which would push the rest of our team behind. I decided to sit down with them and try to understand why they were unable to meet project timelines. I learned in that conversation that they hadn’t been properly trained on our project management software and didn’t have a good line of sight into due dates. I was able to help them access training resources and answer some of their questions.,Behavioral,Good

Earlier in my career, I had a really hard time with setting boundaries in terms of communicating my capacity to take on more work and would frequently find myself with more to do than I could handle.

Marketing Manager,How do you decide when to stop investing in a brand strategy and move on to another idea?,"One of the challenges about brand management is that it takes time to solidify a brand, so we may not see the impact of a campaign until it has been running for a while already.

If we fail to meet multiple benchmarks, I would start transitioning away from that project.",Technical,Good
Sales Manager,How do you delegate?,"In my previous position, it was my first time managing a team at work. I quickly learned the value of delegating because I thought I could do it all without help but realized my team members were capable and sharing responsibilities was efficient. I asked my manager to help me find my delegation strategy, so I can use it with my team and found that collaborative delegation works for me. After that, I held a team meeting where we discussed the assignments we needed to complete so we can finish a project by its deadline in two months. We had team members volunteer to work on some assignments together so they could combine their skill sets. Others took tasks in which we knew they were going to be successful. Then we talked about when our check-in dates were going to be as an effort to ensure everyone was on task and following the directions. After they completed their tasks, we all had another meeting to discuss any feedback and give each other recognition for their work.",Behavioral,Good
Sales Manager,How do you delegate?,"I value delegating tasks at work very much because it helps complete assignments quicker. I've also found it instills confidence and motivation in my team when I trust them enough to give them more responsibility at work.

When I approach them, I ask if they feel comfortable adding another task to their list so I can respect their boundaries. At my first managing job, I had someone share with me they didn't have the space to take on a new task at this moment and I respected their honesty. After that, I went to my next choice of who I thought would do well with the assignment. This allowed both team members to finish their respective tasks on time and do well because they had the proper space and time to complete them. I feel like I'm very good at delegating because I consider my decisions carefully and communicate well with team members.",Behavioral,Good
Marketing Manager,How do you determine which features you should add to your product?,"When I'm determining which additions to add to a product, I'll typically start by conducting research on our current users. I'll review insights to determine which features they're currently using the most and will determine what type of updates I can add to make that specific feature more enjoyable for them. Another method I use is reviewing the comments and feedback that users will leave on our software or the input they provide our sales or customer service teams. I'll use these to determine what can be added to enhance they're overall experience.",Technical,Good
Marketing Manager,How do you develop and track the success of a marketing campaign?,"In my experience, I developed marketing campaigns by collabourating with other people on my team.

Marketing Manager,How do you know when a product is designed well?,"A product is well-designed when it’s simple, intuitive and promises what it delivers.

Last year, I worked with our IT department to implement a communication system for scheduling procedures to ensure that all departments had enough staff members. Our new online scheduling portal increased communication efficiency by 20%. To stay informed about their ongoing concerns, I hold regular meetings with various health care personnel. I've been enjoying that part of my work and I'm especially interested in bringing the experience I've gained to the team at ABC Health.

I also understand that it's important to be fair to others on the team who meet their performance targets, and I want to be able to dedicate my time to the whole group in a productive, equitable manner. Whenever I had to consider terminating an employee in the past, I was always clear with that person about paths to improvement and the consequences of not meeting those goals.

When clients and customers want compensation from a situation that doesn't meet their expectations, it's often challenging to decide how to diffuse the conflict and keep them satisfied. Recently I had a client who insisted on getting a refund, even though their issue was due to their own user error. I had to decide if I wanted to issue the refund so I could attend to a store full of other customers or if I wanted to calm down the customer and explain the issue. While the first option may have saved time, I used my training and asked colleagues to assist with other customers while I deescalated the situation.

Before approaching them about the situation, I walked around the building and took a few deep breaths to stay calm. This strategy allowed me to calmly confront the team member about their lack of effort.
