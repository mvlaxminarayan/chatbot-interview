11,Nurse,tell me what you feel your greatest skill as a nurse is,Conclusion,I'm very proud of my ability to really listen to what a patient is telling me.

Compassion and empathy allow you to share your similar experiences with them and to become vulnerable by trusting the relationship you are able to build with them in a short period of time. I feel that this is an extremely important skill because as a nurse you will encounter hundreds maybe even thousands of patients and their family members across the span of your career and the ability to connect with them is a key to your success in whatever setting you decide to work in.  You will learn a myriad of technical skills along the way that might be useful fun or easy to employ during procedures but the key to nursing is the relationship and trust you build with your patients.

It was one of his cases that made me think that paediatric nursing was the right field for me. Just before I chose my Alevel subjects my father treated John a 5yearold patient whom he diagnosed with bone cancer.    It was a challenging experience not only for John but also for my family members because my father would tell us about John and how brave he was while undergoing painful treatment. The only thing that bothered my father was that there weren't enough qualified paediatric nurses to support John in between chemotherapy sessions. The thought of that really affected me and it was what helped me make the decision to go to nursing school. Even now I'm grateful for that. Helping and supporting children and their families is what I was born to do.,Good
80,Nurse,tell me about yourself,Introduction,I started working as a general nurse at a local hospital four years ago just after graduating from university. Working at a public healthcare facility allowed me to gain a lot of experience and observe how nurses from different specialisations operate.

As a mental health nurse I can build longerlasting relationships with my patients which is something I'm Good at.,Good

To date I've worked at a private clinic that supported emergency patient cases from a nearby public hospital whenever it had a case overload.

134,Nurse,describe a time you had to deal with a difficult patient and how you handled that,Communication,Working with elderly patients always presents unique challenges as you're dealing with people who are used to being independent and who are now totally reliant on strangers. I remember one gentleman who had a reputation for being extremely difficult. He was angry and argumentative and would often fight with the other nurses over things as little as the temperature of his room. I admit I wasn't excited when I found out I was going to be working with him so to prepare I looked over his charts. I discovered that his wife had died a number of years ago and that he had no friends or family in the area and hadn't had a visitor in ages. Rather than treating him just as a patient I did my best to connect with him as a human. I would talk to him not just at him. It took a little but eventually he came around and ended up being one of my favorite people to visit with every day.,Good
135,Nurse,describe a time you had to deal with a difficult patient and how you handled that,Communication,I once had a patient who had a new order for wound care. His responsible party did not like how I dressed his wound. She thought that I should have used a different type of dressing. To ease her concerns I reassured her I was following the doctor's orders. In layman's terms I then explained the treatment order to her step by step and asked if she had any questions. She let me know that she was unaware of the order change and thanked me for taking the time to explain everything to her in a way she could understand. I apologized that the new orders were not relayed to her and let her know that I was available if she had any more questions,Good
136,Nurse,describe a time you had to deal with a difficult patient and how you handled that,Communication,While working overnight as a pediatric nurse I had a 15yearold patient under my care who we were treating for an infection. The patient called me into the room several times within an hour with various concerns. I sat down with them to ask how they were feeling.    It turned out that they were worried about their situation and not used to being away from home. I spent a few minutes asking about their pets at home and brought an extra snack before arranging a phone call with their family to help better reassure them. After that they went to sleep and no longer called repeatedly during the remainder of their treatment. From this experience I learned to look beyond patients' attitudes for underlying concerns.,Good
137,Nurse,why should we hire you,Conclusion,For me nursing it's just a career it's a passion. As a result I spend time seizing opportunities to learn and grow prioritize patient care at every step and embrace advances that can lead to higher quality outcomes. Additionally I know the value of teamwork and agility and also enjoy the challenges that come with this job.

I've also developed excellent communication skills through interacting with patients families as well as other nurses and doctors.

141,Nurse,when you don't have an answer to a patient's question what do you do,Communication,If I don't know the answer my first step is to let the patient know I need time to get the information they need. Then I'll use a combination approach conducting research on my own while also conferring with colleagues with expertise in that arena. Along with ensuring I have a thorough understanding of the answer this allows me to develop a sound way to relay it to the patient increasing overall accuracy and understanding.,Good
142,Nurse,what do you do when you don't know an answer to a patient's question or how to address a situation,Technical,When I start my shift I go over patients' diagnoses and medications. If I'm unfamiliar with anything I do quick research and learn what I need to know. It could be about signs and symptoms prognosis side effects of medications adverse reactions contraindications etc. If I am still unsure I ask a more experienced nurse or a provider. If I have questions about medication sometimes I call the pharmacist and get clarification. And if I don't understand something I don't try to guess. I'll contact my nursing supervisor or ask someone with experience. I don't let my lack of knowledge affect patient care.,Good
143,Nurse,what do you do when you don't know an answer to a patient's question or how to address a situation,Technical,When I don't understand something at work or have the answer to a question I look for help. I don't let my pride get in the way of quality patient care. I'm honest in saying that I don't know the answer but I will get it then quickly ask someone who has more experience or knowledge.,Good
144,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,My preferred approach always focuses on communication and empathy. For example in one of my last positions a fellow nurse was regularly late for their shift start. This harmed the transition causing the team to fall behind. Instead of filing complaints or berating them I took them aside and asked if they were having challenges getting to work on time. It turned out that there was a childcare challenge one that would be solved with a different shift. I helped them arrange for a schedule change and the problem was solved something that wouldn't have happened without communication and empathy.,Good
145,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,n most cases I handle conflict well. I value diversity and understand that different people have different opinions which may lead to conflict. When faced with conflict I work to collaborate with others to resolve the issue in a way that is mutually beneficial for everyone involved. Sometimes I can become defensive when trying to express my opinion. I am practicing tactics to manage this behavior such as pausing to take a deep breath and carefully considering my words before responding.,Good
146,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,While working on a project for a previous employer one of my team members regularly challenged every solution I presented. He also had a tendency to interrupt and talk over others without listening to their input. I experienced a challenge in maintaining my patience when he interrupted others without listening. It reached a point where our respective managers counseled both of us on our behavior.    To resolve this conflict I had to recognize that I cannot change or control his behavior. I also acknowledged that this behavior from both of us was likely a result of stress due to the heavy workload of the project. Therefore I adjusted my own communication style to increase empathy avoid triggers and build patience with interruptions. We were able to complete the project and maintain polite correspondence whenever we needed to work together after that.,Good
147,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,In my previous experience I was working with a group to prepare a presentation for leadership. The group was responsible for conceptualizing an idea and presenting a project plan to implement the idea. We selected an idea and developed an action plan for completing the presentation. Two of the team members wanted to hold daily meetings to discuss the plan and progress. Other team members including myself disagreed with this approach because the team had a log to report task progress and completion.     As long as everyone knew their assigned tasks we did not think we needed to divert time for meetings that would not move the project forward. We also thought these meetings would use valuable time needed to complete the project. Instead of starting an argument about the meetings we gathered everyone together to explain their reasoning for their side. Eventually we decided to hold a daily meeting that would last no more than ten minutes to provide short updates on task progress.,Good
148,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,When preparing data about the success of past projects to request funding for a new project in our department a supervisor asked me to delete data records for projects that were less successful. I knew that deleting these records would skew the results and representation of our past performance. I expressed this concern to my supervisor but she insisted that I remove the data.     After careful consideration I decided to discuss the issue with the next level of management which dismissed my concerns and supported the decision to remove the data. Ultimately I removed data as directed but I also changed the language in the report to clearly communicate that the reported data represented successful projects to ensure I accurately represented the information. I also documented the situation including data records removed from reported results in the event of questioning or an audit.     I understood my supervisor's decision for the request but I could not compromise my values. I tried to create a compromise in removing the data and adding the language. We did eventually receive funding for our project based on the reports.,Good
149,Nurse,describe a time when you were in conflict with a fellow nurse how did you handle the situation,Communication,In one of my previous jobs the human resources director wanted to capture personal identifying informationsuch as social security numbers on job applications. He was insistent that the information would be secure and though I believed him I still disagreed with this practice. I understood that human resources needed to collect this information at the point of hire to verify employment eligibility but I did not agree with collecting it from every applicant.     I expressed my opinion that requiring this information on the application could negatively impact our talent pool but also acknowledged that I was not a human resources professional and it was not my decision. The human resources director acknowledged my opinion but believed it was the best practice. I trusted him as the experienced professional to make the correct choice.,Good
150,Nurse,can you describe how you would resolve a conflict with a fellow nurse or healthcare professional,Communication,Effective communication and professionalism are key in resolving workplace conflicts. I would first seek a private conversation with the individual involved expressing my concerns calmly and listening to their perspective. If we're unable to reach a resolution or if the issue persists I would seek advice or intervention from a supervisor or HR always keeping the focus on maintaining a productive and positive work environment for the Good of our patients.,Good
151,Nurse,can you describe how you would resolve a conflict with a fellow nurse or healthcare professional,Communication,I would ask that as a health care team we put together a kind of pitch for each treatment path and offer these in a neutral way to the patient. We would also come up with a timeframe for when we should see results as well as establish some Good indicators of what progress will look like. We would tell the patient the pros and cons for increasing physiotherapy or for more bed rest. I would offer to present the options to the patient so that they would be presented neutrally. We respect the patient's fully informed decision and embark on that care strategy. If they exhibit progress according to our rubric we continue. If we see any warning signs or stagnation we would potentially present the options to the patient again.,Good
152,Home Health Aide,what are your responsibilities as a home health aide,Conclusion,The responsibilities of a Home Health Aide HHA include providing personal care and assistance to patients in their homes. This may include tasks such as bathing dressing grooming toileting and transferring. HHAs also provide light housekeeping duties such as laundry and meal preparation and may run errands for the patient. In addition HHAs provide companionship and emotional support to patients and their families,Good
153,Nurse,what are the vital signs,Introduction,Temperature pulse respiration bp  O2  amp pain level,Poor
154,Nurse,what would you do if a patients vital signs suddenly dropped,Communication,In this critical situation my immediate response would be to summon medical help and commence appropriate interventions based on my nursing expertise and the patient's symptoms. Until assistance arrives I would maintain close monitoring of the patient ensuring their safety and soothing their apprehensions. Quick poised and assured action is the key to ensure optimal patient outcomes.,Good
155,Nurse,what would you do if a patients vital signs suddenly dropped,Communication,f a patient suddenly became unresponsive my first course of action would be to assess the situation and determine if there is an immediate threat to the patient's life. I would then call for help from other medical personnel and begin CPR or other necessary resuscitation measures. After that I would contact the patient's family members and notify them of the situation. Finally I would document all actions taken in the patient's chart and follow up with any additional orders given by the attending physician.    My experience as a circulating nurse has taught me how to respond quickly and calmly in emergency situations. I am confident that I can handle such a situation with professionalism and efficiency.,Good
156,Nurse,can you share an instance when you went above and beyond in caring for someone,Conclusion,My experience at a retirement home as a volunteer offered an instance where I was able to extend my care beyond the usual responsibilities. One of the residents an elderly lady frequently experienced feelings of isolation and loneliness. Recognizing her emotional needs I made the decision to invest additional time to engage with her. Beyond addressing her physical requirements we shared conversations and participated in her preferred hobbies together. This endeavor not only alleviated her feelings of loneliness but also underlined the importance of holistic care in nursing that goes beyond just addressing physical health.,Good
157,Nurse,can you share an instance when you went above and beyond in caring for someone,Conclusion,I was caring for an elderly cancer patient who didn't have much time remaining unfortunately. His final wish was to enjoy a drink with his lifetime friends. Normally alcohol is not permitted on this floor of the hospital but I spoke with the department head and asked if there was any way to arrange an exception to grant this patient's final wish.    The next week the department head agreed and we were able to let this patient's friends join him for a small gathering and bring a bottle of whiskey.,Good
158,Nurse,how do you handle a situation where your replacement does not arrive on time,Communication,I contact my replacement roughly an hour before my shift ends to ensure that they would arrive on time. If they communicate that there might be a delay or absence I help them find a substitute to take their shift or inform the senior nurse or doctor when I cannot find a substitute. In either case I make sure to not leave my post until my replacement arrives.,Good

I wanted the individuals that served to afford the ammenitys in life that you or I could afford meaning if they wanted to go out to a night club and dance why couldt they I made it happen. If they were going to a prom they wore tuxedos not just anything thrown together We pulled resources together and made it happen. No matter the sweat and work it took if the 8 individuals wanted to see the lights on BeravSquare despite which I did not know at the time  thousands of people that were going to be there. We went suffered through the traffic to park and get 8 individuals with wheel chairs and a dog out to experience 10 minutes of Fire works but you know it was worth to be able to feel the cold air and be amongst hundreds of people they were happy and I was happy. Less,Average
237,Nurse,describe a time a patient was really happy with your care or a time you went above and beyond for a patient,Communication,I once had a patient who continued to be readmitted to the hospital because of congestive heart failure CHF. When I came on my shift and started talking with her I realized she was newly diagnosed with CHF and did not understand the dietary restrictions. So I took the time to explain what a fluid restriction and no added salt diet was. I wrote everything down and gave her examples of food high in sodium to avoid. Then I asked the physician to provide her with a referral for a dietary consult while in the hospital. I mentioned that I thought she would benefit from home healthcare when she was discharged. A few months later she mailed a card to the unit thanking me and letting us know she hadn't been admitted for CHF since she was discharged and was doing well.,Good
238,Nurse,describe a situation when you had to work with a difficult coworker what was the problem and how did you resolve it,Communication,I had a coworker who worked the opposite shift of me who would rush me when she gave report during the handoff. Often she would only give me partial information about a patient and sometimes I received no information at all. It was frustrating to me and it caused tension between us. One day I came to work ten minutes early. I politely informed her that her handoffs often caused misinformation about our patients. I suggested we do walking rounds so that there was no miscommunication about patients and we didn't miss anything. She agreed that it was a Good resolution. That situation taught me how to speak up for myself and confront a problem headon.,Good
239,Nurse,describe a time you were under a lot of pressure how did you handle it,Communication,It was my week on call and I was also the staff development nurse. Every day I was called or had to go to the facility to handle an issue. It was really stressful because it felt like I was being pulled in ten different directions. Not only did I have to make sure my job was complete but I also had to be there when something went wrong or if someone called out. To cut down on the stress and the back and forth I had each nurse leave me a report. Additionally I told them I would address any nonemergent issues the following day when I got to work. I decided to get to work about ten minutes early every day to see what I needed to handle from the day before.,Good
240,Nurse,how would you handle a disagreement with a nurse or doctor,Behavioral,At my previous workplace there was a nurse who would repeatedly lose her temper with the residents. Other members of the team had confronted her about it previously but her behavior didn't change. Following one of these incidents I approached the nurse in question and calmly informed her that her behavior was affecting the wellbeing of the residents. After explaining to her how her actions negatively affected the people she was responsible for taking care of she started making an effort to change.,Good
241,Nurse,how would you handle a disagreement with a doctor,Behavioral,Doctors may handle a lot more patients than nurses. Sometimes it becomes difficult for them to keep track of medical records and patient histories accurately. When there is a discrepancy between a doctor's instructions and a patient's medical records I discuss the issue in detail with the doctor to get it resolved before we take any further action. When we cannot resolve it we take a mutual decision to escalate it to a supervisor.,Average
242,Nurse,tell me about a time when a patient's family was dissatisfied with your care how did you handle that situation,Communication,While I constantly strive to do everything I can for a patient I had a situation once with a patient who complained to my supervisor about me telling them I was denying them specific care for an issue. The first thing I have to do in that situation is to step back and really assess what's going on specifically whether I had acted appropriately. Since I had followed the doctor's orders I spoke with my supervisor and the attending physician about the situation. It turns out that the patient had misunderstood something the doctor had told her leading her to assume I was neglecting a step in her care process. Once the confusion was cleared up we were able to work with the patient to come up with a satisfactory solution,Average
243,Nurse,what is your idea of effective patient and family education,Communication,Effective patient education centers around the patient and family's needs. You have to understand their learning style and adapt accordingly. For example some patients prefer reading medical instructions versus watching a DVD. You also need to figure out what each patient needs. Some want detailed information others just want the necessary information. Including the family in the treatment process is crucial because they may end up serving as primary caretakers for the patient going forward. Show them how vital they are to the process and key them in on how they can help.,Good
244,Nurse,talk about a time a patient or their family was particularly pleased and appreciative of your care,Communication,Working in pediatrics can be challenging but also very rewarding. There are times that parents are unable to stay at the bedside 247 because of work other children or previous commitments. I was taking care of a 6monthold twin during a specific shift. The family was unable to be at the bedside because the father had to work and the mother was at home with the twin sister and the other children. I spent my shift playing with the infant with ageappropriate toys and when the mother called to check in  I put the phone next to the infant. The mother was able to hear her baby laughing while singing to her. This brought them closer together and the mother to tears. She stated that no other nurse had done that during the hospitalization and she was eternally grateful.,Good
245,Nurse,describe a time when your facility was undergoing some change how did that impact you and how did you adapt,Communication,One healthcare system I worked for switched from paper charting to electronic medical records and computerized charting. During this transition it was confusing and often overwhelming. I was able to adapt quickly but unfortunately some of my coworkers were not able to.,Poor
246,Nurse,What do you do when you donâ€™t know the answer to something at work whether itâ€™s how to address a situation or the answer to a patient question,Technical,When I don't understand something at work I seek out help. I don't let my pride get in the way of quality patient care. I generally ask someone who has more experience than me to help out and do it in a timely manner.,Average
247,Nurse,tell me about a time when you didn't know the answer to something at work how did you go about finding the information,Communication,As nurses there is no way that we possibly can know everything. Knowing who to go for help is the first step. At the beginning of every shift I identify a nurse that I can use as a resource such as the charge nurse nurse educator or unit resource nurse. This individual is generally someone that is more senior with an advanced skill set. If I am unable to get the answer from them or they are busy I look at the healthcare systems policy and procedure manager. If there is a concern regarding a medication dosage or interaction I look to LexiComp.,Good
248,Nurse,give me an example of an awkward situation at work how did you remove yourself from the situation,Communication,I once had a teenage male patient make very inappropriate sexual comments towards me. At first I ignored them thinking it was a onetime thing. The second time I told him that the comments were inappropriate and I did not want him to say those things to me. The third time I left the patient's room and went directly to the charge nurse. I explained the situation and how uncomfortable I was in that specific situation and caring for the patient. She gathered a team to speak to the patient. My assignment was switched for the remainder of the shift,Good
249,Nurse,tell me about a time you failed how did you deal with this situation,Communication,Failing is one of the worst feelings in the world either professionally or personally. Working in the ICU setting patients die. We fail them when this happens. I fail them when this happens. After every death there is a debriefing to discuss what went well and what could have been done differently. I take that time to reflect on my participation in the event and if there was something I could have done differently. Failure doesn't equal weakness. It simply is something that we must improve upon.,Average
250,Nurse,talk about a time you worked in a fastpaced setting how do you prioritize tasks while maintaining excellent patient care,Communication,Working in an ICU setting is extremely fastpaced and it is essential to prioritize your tasks for the day. At the beginning of the shift I make a todo list with everything that needs to be accomplished. I put the mustdo things at the top of the list and the things I would like to do at the bottom. Administering medications are placed at the top of the list and washing a patient's hair is further down. While I would love to accomplish everything it just isn't possible.,Good
251,Nurse,give an example of an important goal you set for yourself did you accomplish that goal how did you ensure that you accomplished it,Introduction,I set the goal to earn my pediatric certification. I made a list of things that must be done to achieve that. I signed up for the exam and paid the fee so that way I had to take the exam. There was no backing out.,Good
252,Nurse,give an example of a time when you were able to successfully persuade a patient to agree to something how did you persuade this person,Communication,Ideally we never want to persuade a patient to do something. We would like the patient to agree to it freely. However I did bargain with a child that if he ate his breakfast I would play video games with him afterward. Using a bargaining system worked well to ensure the patient was well nourished.,Good
253,Nurse,tell me about a time when you had to rely on written communication to explain yourself to your team or to a patient,Communication,Most hospitals utilize a text feature to relay quick communication to the medical team. It is important to be concise and give all of the important information. This way the medical team can determine the best course of action,Poor
254,Nurse,talk about a time when you had not communicated well how did you correct the situation,Communication,This often happens when there is a language barrier. I learned that it is always better to ask for an inperson interpreter or utilizing a computer translation software. This ensures there is no miscommunication of information. Unfortunately hand gestures and speaking louder doesn't always work.,Good
255,Nurse,describe a time when you received negative feedback and turned it into something positive,Communication,I was once told that I needed to be more social at work and try and bond with my work colleagues. I disagreed with my manager because I felt that we are there to work and take care of our patients not to make friends. Becoming close friends with coworkers is an added bonus. While I didn't become best friends with anyone from the unit I was able to spend downtime reading and studying to earn additional certifications which helped me secure better jobs and opportunities in nursing.,Average
256,Nurse,what is one professional accomplishment that you are most proud of and why,Conclusion,Earning my advanced pediatric certification is something I worked very hard for and something that validates the years I have spent at the bedside,Average
257,Nurse,have you ever felt dissatisfied with your work as a nurse what could have been done to make it better,Behavioral,I once became extremely dissatisfied because I was consistently being given easier assignments and not being given the ICU level patients. It became frustrating and while I understood that others needed to learn and gain experience it quickly left me annoyed with my position the unit and the healthcare system. I sat down and spoke to my nurse manager about my concerns and to inquire why it was happening. The nurse manager was not aware of the situation and it was later determined that a few of the charge nurses were giving the sicker patients to their friends and not spreading them out amongst the nurses.,Average
258,Nurse,describe a time when you went over and above your job requirements what motivated you to put forth the extra effort,Communication,I personally feel like I give 110 to all of my patients every shift but there was one that I grew especially close with. For some reason the patient had been dropped off by a family member and no one had come to see the child for months. It was obvious the patient was missing key developmental milestones and was becoming increasingly lonely and depressed. I asked to become the primary nurse for the patient which meant every time I worked he would be assigned to me. I worked with him over several months to get him potty trained and to improve his vocabulary. I don't know exactly why I was extra motivated but at that time in our lives the patient and I needed each other.,Good
259,Nurse,give an example of a mistake you've made how did you handle it,Communication,Mistakes are part of nursing whether we like to admit to it or not. It's important to learn from those mistakes and become a better nurse. One mistake that I will never forget is leaving the gastronomy tube unclamped with medication administration. Because it was unclamped when I opened the port to give the next medication the last medication as well as formula came out. I was unable to clamp it quickly enough and the medications I had already given were leaking onto the bed. I had to speak with the medical team and pharmacy to discuss replacing them. I have never forgotten to clamp the gastronomy tube again.,Good

Certainly some of them will and it may impact me negatively in work. But I also know that everyone starts somewhere and we learn from our mistakes. Nobody leaves the school with ten years of healthcare experience We all have to gain the experience often the hard way. Yet I want to assure you that I am eager to learn and motivated to give my very best each and every day at work.,Average

1032,Home Health Aide,Why do you want to be a caregiver,Introduction,Caring for my grandma who had mobility issues inspired me to become a caregiver. I cared for her for more than five years and through that experience I learned that I'm passionate about helping people and improving the daily lives of individuals in need of care. Supporting my grandma taught me skills like patience compassion and problemsolving. I learned how to address issues quickly and effectively to ensure my grandma was healthy and safe.  I checked on her twice a day while I was caring for her. During each visit I helped prepare meals and complete housekeeping tasks allowing her to assist me with some chores so she could maintain a sense of independence when I wasn't there. While the work was challenging improving my grandma's quality of life made it worthwhile. I'd love to apply my skills to help make the same impact at this organization.,Good

I also helped him learn to use his assistive walking devices so he could gain more independence. Still I helped the mother schedule physical therapy appointments so the child could progress further in his recovery.

My initial plan to complete my undergraduate degree in four years was now out of reach but I gained so much more by sticking with something I enjoyed.

Though it was not as initially planned rather than just having 1 degree I was able to get 2 and gain a lot of life experience along the way.,Unrated
1109,Nurse,how do you ensure you meet the goals you set for yourself,Behavioral,To ensure I meet a goal once I set it for myself is to start by making it realistic and attainable. Setting expectations for myself is important and holding myself to those is how I like to continue to improve as an individual. By setting smaller goals or objectives for myself both professionally and personally I am able to meet smaller milestones and continue to work toward the larger goals. An example of this was when I got into nursing school. Rather than just setting a goal to maintain straight A's I set smaller goals semester by semester to ensure I would keep up this standard for myself. This process has carried over to my professional goals and I am now more likely to follow through with something I have started.,Unrated
1110,Nurse,how do you prioritize your patient's needs when you are given a full assignment and have numerous tasks to complete,Communication,It is important for me to prioritize things based on how critical it is and how timesensitive any given situation may be. By doing this I am able to fully assess what needs to get done and when. With a full assignment I have also learned to ask for help when I am struggling and delegate tasks throughout the shift when appropriate. Sometimes this is not possible and there is no one around to help so I am left to critically think about what needs to get done first and what can wait.,Unrated
1111,Nurse,tell me about a time when you were required to use a form of written communication to express your ideas how did you do so effectively,Communication,Throughout a given shift we are using both verbal and written communication with each other patients staff as well as in our charting. But one time that really stuck out to me was with a patient who was deaf. We did not have a sign language interpreter at the facility and everyone was wearing masks at the time so lip reading their preferred aid in communication was altered. We began writing messages to each other to best suit the patient's needs until we could get a sign language interpreter set up by video chat. The time it took to write everything down and explain certain results was nothing compared to the gratitude this patient had for our staff that day. She had said it was the first time she had felt anyone cared to try to communicate with her without an interpreter and she was given an opportunity to ask questions with ease.,Unrated
1112,Nurse,tell me about a time you were the sole educator in a given situation how did you ensure everyone understood,Communication,At the last hospital I worked at there were smaller committees of employees that were trained to use new devices and equipment. It was then that committee's job to ensure all employees on the unit were efficiently trained and able to safely handle the new device or equipment. I was on the committee that focused on safe patient handling and ergonomics on the floor. One training we had was for a lifting device that hoisted a patient up and allowed staff to not have to lift too much weight by themselves. I then reported back to each member of my own department and provided the training for this new tool that they could use. After I explained and demonstrated the use I had each employee take the lead and had them use the lift to ensure they understood all the parts and mechanisms within it.,Unrated
1113,Nurse,when was a time that you felt that you had failed what was your interpretation of the situation and what happened after,Communication,I think most nurses have felt this way at some point during the nursing program. A time when I felt like I had failed was during nursing school. I had a hard time working through a skills lab and felt like I was failing as a nursing student. I had limited experience going in and it seemed like everyone else was easily grasping the skills. My instructors reassured me that I would catch on but I was not satisfied with my performance and knew I needed extra help. I then set up a time outside of the program to get extra practice. This helped me feel more confident going into the skills checks and I was more prepared for my first job because of it.,Unrated
1114,Nurse,when was a time when you didn't meet a patient's expectations what happened and how did you resolve the situation,Communication,As a nurse it is always important to put a patient's needs first. In a busy emergency department the highest priority goes to those that are most critical. Not every patient understands this. I was working in an ER at a level 1 trauma center when 3 critical patients came in within the same hour. They required immediate attention and therefore other patients were not getting their results as quickly and the radiology department was also getting backed up. One of my patients got upset because we had told her she would be going for an xray soon but things had changed. She complained about her wait time and pain and was displeased with the service. Because this was not a new experience for me I simply sat down with her and explained the circumstances. She was seen by the doctor shortly after who also explained the same thing. We both took the time to inform her of the problem and this seemed to help. She was reasonably annoyed but did not speak up about it again once we put things into perspective.,Unrated
1115,Nurse,when was a time you were able to be creative in the workplace what was challenging and what did you enjoy about this experience,Communication,A time when I had to be creative in the workplace was when I floated to the Emergency Department for the first time. I was helping with tasks and was helping a tech with placing a splint for a broken radius. There are standards with regards to the placement but some creativity comes in when you are performing the task. It became almost an art form when we were asked to do a plaster splint because of the varying techniques. To make it smooth and functional we had to be creative in the placement and cuts we made for the best results.,Unrated
1116,Nurse,when was a time you were overwhelmed and how did you overcome it,Conclusion,A time when I felt extremely overwhelmed was my first few months as a new graduate nurse. I hadn't yet figured out how to appropriately delegate tasks and I felt like I was always behind. To add to that we had only one CNA for my unit and all of the nurses worked together to decide the best use of our one CNA resource for the shift. I overcame it by better prioritizing my tasks and asking for help when I needed it. Over the years I have also learned to delegate a lot more and use this as a tool to not only relieve some of the pressure off my shoulders but to best care for my patients. I also learned that when I was behind I wasn't able to provide quality care for my patient and they were really the ones suffering most.
